# Third-party notices

OpenScreen is MIT licensed (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). The installers additionally
bundle the pre-built native components below. This file ships inside the
application resources and satisfies the attribution and source-offer obligations
that come with them.

npm dependencies are not listed here: they are resolved from `package.json` and
distributed by their own registries, not redistributed inside our binaries.

The optional Remotion integration is listed separately below because its license
has terms that are different from this repository's MIT license.

---

## Remotion 4.0.521 — optional animation runtime

- **Components**: the optional packages declared in
  `integrations/remotion/package.json`, including `remotion`,
  `@remotion/bundler`, `@remotion/media`, `@remotion/player`,
  `@remotion/renderer`, and `@remotion/transitions`, all pinned to `4.0.521`
  where applicable.
- **Use**: local `animation` and `mixed` manifest rendering only. Remotion is
  not required by recording-only workflows and is not part of the upstream
  OpenScreen app version `1.10.0`.
- **License**: Remotion's separate license, reproduced by reference at
  <https://www.remotion.dev/license>. The source license for the pinned
  `4.0.521` release is
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remotion-dev/remotion/v4.0.521/LICENSE.md>.
  These terms are version-specific; reread the upstream license before moving
  to another Remotion major version.
- **Free-license eligibility**: the Remotion license lists individuals,
  for-profit organizations with up to three employees, nonprofit or
  not-for-profit organizations, and non-commercial evaluation as eligible for
  its free terms. Eligible users may use Remotion commercially for creating
  videos and images and may modify it for a custom use case or to contribute
  improvements.
- **Restrictions and company license**: the license disallows copying or
  modifying Remotion code to sell, rent, license, relicense, or sublicense a
  derivative of Remotion. A for-profit organization outside the listed free
  eligibility must obtain a Remotion Company License. MEGA RECORDER does not
  purchase, activate, or distribute that license; each user or organization is
  responsible for evaluating its own eligibility and obligations.
- **Assets and network**: the runtime uses local media by default and the
  manifest schema defaults `allowRemoteAssets` to `false`. Running its setup
  command may resolve the pinned packages from their registries; rendering and
  preview do not require an AI provider or API key.

## FFmpeg — shared libraries (Windows only)

- **Components**: `avcodec-*.dll`, `avformat-*.dll`, `avutil-*.dll`,
  `swresample-*.dll`, `swscale-*.dll` and their siblings, under
  `resources/electron/native/bin/win32-*/`.
- **Used by**: the native D3D11 compositor addon, which links against them at
  load time.
- **License**: **GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 or later**
  (<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>). FFmpeg's own
  licensing page: <https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html>.
- **This is an LGPL build, not a GPL one.** It is configured without
  `--enable-gpl` and without `--enable-nonfree`, and links no GPL-only library
  (x264, x265, xvid, vidstab, rubberband, frei0r, …). `scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs`
  verifies this before vendoring — it reads `ffmpeg -L`, `-buildconf` and
  `-encoders` and refuses any binary that reports otherwise.
- **Upstream binaries**: BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds, release
  `autobuild-2026-07-31-14-10`, the `*-lgpl-shared-8.1` assets. Pinned by
  SHA-256 in `scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs`; the digests there identify the exact
  artifacts we ship.
  <https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/tag/autobuild-2026-07-31-14-10>
- **Corresponding source**: FFmpeg n8.1.2, commit `9b6c8969e0`, from
  <https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg>. The build configuration and scripts that
  produced these exact binaries are published at
  <https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds>.
- **Relinking**: as required by the LGPL, these are dynamic libraries. You may
  replace them with your own build of the same FFmpeg version by overwriting the
  DLLs in `resources/electron/native/bin/win32-*/`.

## whisper.cpp and ggml

- **Components**: `whisper-stt-server` and its ggml backend sidecars, under
  `resources/electron/native/bin/<platform>-<arch>/`.
- **License**: MIT — <https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp> and
  <https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml>.
- Built from source by `scripts/build-whisper-stt.sh`; the pinned upstream
  revision is in `electron/native/whisper-stt/CMakeLists.txt`.
- The speech model (`ggml-*.bin`) is **not** bundled — it is downloaded into the
  user's data directory on first use by `electron/stt/modelManager.ts`.

## ONNX Runtime (Windows and Apple Silicon macOS)

- **Component**: `onnxruntime.dll` / `libonnxruntime.dylib`, under
  `resources/electron/native/bin/<platform>-<arch>/`.
- **License**: MIT — <https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime>.
- Not built here: the pinned upstream release archive is downloaded, SHA-256
  verified and unpacked by `scripts/fetch-onnxruntime.mjs`, which also checks the
  archive's own LICENSE really is MIT before vendoring anything.
- **Why it ships**: the native compositor segments the webcam subject with it, on
  the CPU execution provider, to drive the camera background cutout/blur/custom
  modes. The `gpu_cuda*` builds are deliberately not used — they are an order of
  magnitude larger and carry NVIDIA redistribution terms.
- **Not on Intel macOS**: upstream publishes no `osx-x86_64` asset from 1.27 on,
  so the x64 DMG ships without it and the camera background effects are simply
  absent there. Not shipped on Linux either, where the compositor has no capture
  path for the mask yet.
- The segmentation model it runs is a separate component, immediately below.

## MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation — model weights

- **Components**: `selfie_segmentation.tflite`,
  `selfie_segmentation_landscape.tflite` and the `selfie_segmentation_landscape.onnx`
  derived from them, shipped inside `app.asar` under `dist/mediapipe/`.
- **License**: Apache-2.0 — <https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/selfie_segmentation>.
  Copyright The MediaPipe Authors.
- The `.onnx` is a **derived work**, generated from the vendored `.tflite` by
  `scripts/convert-selfie-segmentation-to-onnx.py`. No third-party weights are
  downloaded at build time.
- **Why it is listed here**: these weights are redistributed inside the installer,
  and Apache-2.0 §4 asks that the attribution travel with them. The provenance note
  in `public/mediapipe/selfie_segmentation/README.md` does not — electron-builder's
  `"!*.md"` filter strips it from the package — so this file is the only copy a user
  ever receives.
- The MediaPipe **JavaScript** solution and its two ~5.6 MB WASM builds are no longer
  bundled: inference moved into the native compositor, and nothing loaded them.

## Microsoft OpenMP runtime — `vcomp140.dll` (Windows only)

- **Component**: `resources/electron/native/bin/win32-x64/vcomp140.dll`.
- **License**: redistributable under the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
  terms accompanying Visual Studio; the copy shipped is taken from the
  `VC\Redist\MSVC\<version>\x64\Microsoft.VC<nnn>.OpenMP\` directory of the
  Visual Studio installation that builds the release, never from `System32`.
- **Why it ships**: the ggml backends above are compiled with OpenMP and import
  it. It is **not** part of Windows, so without it `whisper-stt-server` dies in
  the loader before `main()` on any machine that has no Visual C++
  Redistributable, and transcription and captions fail with no usable error.
  Staged by `scripts/stage-vcomp-runtime.mjs`; `scripts/before-pack.cjs` refuses
  to package if it is missing while anything still imports it.

## PipeWire — headers (Linux only)

- **Components**: header sources under
  `electron/native/pipewire-capture/vendor/pipewire-1.0.5/include/`, compiled
  into `openscreen-pipewire-helper` (the Linux cursor/capture helper) under
  `resources/electron/native/bin/linux-*/`.
- **License**: **MIT** — <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire>.
  Every vendored file keeps its upstream `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` header,
  and the project's licence text is copied alongside them as `COPYING`.
- **Upstream**: PipeWire release 1.0.5. Only the header subset the helper
  includes was vendored; `vendor/README.md` records exactly what was copied and
  how to reproduce the selection.
- **No PipeWire binary is redistributed.** The helper resolves
  `libpipewire-0.3.so.0` with `dlopen` at runtime, from the user's own system,
  so nothing of PipeWire's ships inside our installers beyond the compiled
  result of its headers (inline functions and struct layouts).

## OpenScreen native helpers

`wgc-capture` (Windows Graphics Capture), the ScreenCaptureKit helper (macOS),
the PipeWire helper (Linux) and the compositor addon are part of this repository
and are covered by [LICENSE](LICENSE).
