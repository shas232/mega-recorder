// Every path that can reach the undo stack, pinned.
//
// #433 has now produced three rounds of the SAME defect: a write the user never
// made recording itself as the thing their next Ctrl+Z reverses. Each round the
// fix was aimed at the instance.
//
//   1. `setDocument` was the only writer that recorded, so nothing the user did
//      was on the stack at all.
//   2. `probeAndCorrectClip` -- a background duration probe -- recorded, because
//      `history` defaulted to `true` and the probe said nothing. Making the option
//      REQUIRED was supposed to end it: omitting it is now a compile error.
//   3. It did not. `projectStore.replaceTimeline(intervals, reason)` hardcoded
//      `{ history: true }` INSIDE itself, so the option never appeared in the
//      signature its callers see and no compile error could reach them. Its one
//      caller is the unattended recording import that runs on editor mount, so a
//      user landed in a brand-new project with `past.length === 1` and their first
//      Ctrl+Z emptied the timeline.
//
// The compiler can force a DIRECT call site to decide. It cannot see that the
// function doing the deciding had no business deciding. That is a judgement about
// who triggered the write, and the only place to record a judgement is next to the
// code, in a table somebody has to edit.
//
// So: this file is the table. A new write, a moved one, or a changed `history`
// value fails here with a diff, and the only way to make it pass is to write down
// what triggers it.
//
// What a green run here means, exactly. The scan is SYNTACTIC: it walks the
// non-test `.ts`/`.tsx` under `src/`, matches calls on the callee's written name,
// and reads each one's trigger off the object literal at the call site. So the
// table covers every `saveDocument` / `setDocument` written as such in shipped
// renderer code, and the tests below it pin the names an entry can reach a stack
// through -- `recordHistory`, called only by those two writers, then `pushHistory`,
// plus undo/redo's own two pushes for the entries they step over.
//
// And the third writer, which neither of those names covers:
// `useProjectStore.setState({ document })` puts a document in the store around both
// of them. Four shipped sites do it -- undo's own restore, and the three rollbacks
// that put a document back when a save failed -- and every one of them means to,
// because none of them is an edit. But a `history` option that cannot be omitted is
// no guard at all against a writer that never takes one, so those sites are rows
// too, carrying `unrecorded`: out of scope for the stack, in scope for the
// guarantee, and a new one has to come here and say who asked. The match is keyed on
// the RECEIVER as well as the name, because `useTranscriptionStore.setState` is a
// different store and writes no document.
//
// What it does not see, so nobody reads more into that than is in it:
//   - INDIRECTION, both ways round. The callee name is whatever the source says,
//     so a write reached through an alias or a callback is not a row at all. And
//     `readonly` on the stacks is erased at runtime, so `(past as Snapshot[]).push(...)`
//     compiles, runs, and appears nowhere here -- the `@ts-expect-error`s below
//     pin the un-cast form only.
//   - DATAFLOW. `forwarded` asks where the identifier handed on was BOUND, not
//     what value arrives in it. A parameter reassigned to a hardcode is still a
//     parameter, and so is a callback parameter the same expression supplies from
//     a literal. Both read as forwarded; the last describe in this file pins them
//     saying so.
// Neither shape is in the tree today, and finding either is a reading job, not this
// file's. What this file guarantees is the part a reading job keeps missing: that
// nobody added a write in plain sight -- through either recording writer or straight
// into the store -- without saying who asked for it.
